# Spark-fund-Investment-Analysis
Business and Data Understanding:
Spark Funds has two minor constraints for investments:     
(1) It wants to invest between 5 to 15 million USD per round of investment      
(2) It wants to invest only in English-speaking countries because of the ease of communication with the companies it would invest in     
For this analysis, I have to consider a country to be English speaking only if English is one of the official languages in that country
